- I am a data scientist and part of the health services research team of one of the biggest health insurance companies in Switzerland🇨🇭.

- I am interested in medication 💊 prescribing trends 📉, investigating factors that drive over- or under-prescription and their implications for health outcomes. 
The research aims to establish an empirical foundation for optimized medication use and to enrich informed political discussions.
Most of my work projects live on private repositories of my organization's version control platform.

- By training, I am a biostatistician and biologist. 

- My passion lies in R programming and expressing quantitative information using numbers 🎲, models 📈 and visual displays 📊.
