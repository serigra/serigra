- I am a data scientist & researcher and part of the health services research team of one of the biggest health insurance companies in Switzerland🇨🇭.
I am part of the Research Data Team, where we are responsible for the technical infrastructure, extract and process data, conceptualize and implement statistical analyses, and collaborate with internal and external stakeholders on scientific publications and internal analytical projects.

- I am interested in medication 💊 prescribing trends 📉, investigating factors that drive over- or under-prescription and their implications for health outcomes. 
The research aims to establish an empirical foundation for optimized medication use and to enrich informed political discussions.
All my current work projects live on private repositories of my organization's version control platform.

- By training, I am a biostatistician 🎓 and biologist 🎓. 

- Since recently I am member of the organizing committee for the [Zurich R User Group](https://zurich-r-user-group.github.io/).

- My passion lies in R programming and expressing quantitative information using numbers 🎲, models 📈 and visual displays 📊.
